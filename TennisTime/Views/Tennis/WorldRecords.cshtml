                        <tr><td>  Roger Federer  </td><td> Most Grand Slam Titles (17) </td><td> Roger Federer is the winner of the most Grand Slam titles (Australia, French, US Open or Wimbledon), with 17 so far in his career. The awesome Swiss has shown through his long career an ability to adapt his game to any surface, also remaining almost injury-free through 65 Grand Slam tournament appearances.  </td></tr>
                        <tr><td> Jimmy Connors  </td><td> Most ATP Tour Singles Titles (109) </td><td> The Association of Tennis Professionals founded in 1972 awards the most Tour single titles to Jimmy Connors. Jimmy Connors, that fierce competitor from the United States, holds the record by a convincing margin for the most Tour titles won since the ATP Tour was conceived in 1972. He has won 109 tournaments, 15 more than the next most successful, Ivan Lendl.  </td></tr>
                        <tr><td> Rafael Nadal  </td><td> Highest Winning Percentage (82.96%) </td><td> Nadal holds the highest percentage of match victories from total matches played. With 740 victories to 152 defeats, that means a win percentage of 82.96%. It's even higher on clay courts, where Nadal has won 91.87% of all his matches, including those nine French Opens.  </td></tr>

                            <tr><td> Steffi Graf  </td><td> Most Grand Slam Titles (22) </td><td> Steffi Graf, the German who played in the 1980s and '90s, has the most women's Grand Slam title victories with 22 in her career.However, Serena Williams, who currently dominates women's tennis, is only one behind with 21 victories. </td> </tr>
                            <tr><td> Martina Navratilova  </td><td> Most WTP Tour Singles Titles (167) </td><td> Navratilova won one or more Tour events for 21 years between 1974 and 1994, incredible longevity for the Czech-born player who switched allegiance to the United States mid-career. Navratilova has the most, 167, followed by Evert, 157, and Graf with 107. It is almost impossible Serena Williams will break this record, as she is next with 68 titles.   </td></tr>
                            <tr><td> Margaret Court  </td><td> Highest Winning Percentage (91.37%) </td><td> In spite of a relatively small number of WTA Tour matches, Margaret Court has a quite possibly unassailable record for the highest winning percentage on the Tour, with 91.37% victories from her 649 matches on the professional circuit. Evert, with a far longer career, has 89.96% victories, Graf 88.69%, Navratilova 86.82%, and then Serena Williams has 85.66% victories.  </td></tr>
